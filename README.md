# Abstract
The aim of this research is to predict the factors affecting the price of a house. The dataset has certain features that determine the popularity of a house which in turn affects its price. My aim is to figure out which of these features are most likely to attract a potential customer and based on what are the prices determined.

To achieve this, I have made use of Linear Regression where I have plotted Price as the target variable. I have tested the target variable agaisnt multiple features of the house. I have also used Logistic Regression to determine if a certain feature can be predicted given other variables.
